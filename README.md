# PayPal RESTful API Payment Module
This Zen Cart payment module (`paypalr`) combines the processing for the **PayPal Payments Pro** (`paypaldp`) and **PayPal Express Checkout** (`paypalwpp`) payment modules that are currently built into Zen Cart distributions.  Instead of using the older NVP (**N**ame **V**alue **P**air) methods to communicate with PayPal, this payment module uses PayPal's now-current [REST APIs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/) and combines the two legacy methods into one.
